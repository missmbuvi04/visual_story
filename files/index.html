          <h2>Outdoor Experiences</h2>
          <p>
            Our journey began with two powerful visits: the <strong>Nairobi National Museum</strong> and the <strong>Museum of Illusions</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the National Museum, I stood in front of ancient artifacts and political history displays—stories I’d heard before but never truly <em>felt</em>. In the Hall of Human Origins, I was reminded that Kenya is the cradle of humankind. The Museum of Illusions, on the other hand, was playful and strange—it reminded me how perception can shift, just like our understanding of culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, <strong>Kereita Forest</strong> was quiet and grounding. Hiking under the trees, I found mental clarity. Nature is our greatest healer—and that’s something I took personally as someone deeply interested in mental health. The silence wasn’t empty; it was a reflection of rest, resilience, and restoration.

      <h2>Cultural Discoveries Through Local Voices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>“We carry culture in our greetings, not just in our dress.”</em> — Grace, a matatu conductor</li>
        <li><em>“People think Nairobi is always rushing, but look closer—there’s rhythm, not just speed.”</em> — Kevin, a young vendor at Maasai Market</li>
        <li><em>“Mental health is talked about more now. The youth are waking up.”</em> — Zawadi, a student we met near KU</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Personal Mission & Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        My mission in life is rooted in <strong>mental health awareness and emotional wellbeing</strong>. This cultural journey reminded me that identity and mental space are deeply intertwined. How we live, relate, remember—these are cultural acts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fusion dinner at <strong>Peppertree, Waiyaki Way</strong>, symbolized that balance beautifully. Modern and traditional flavors on one plate, just like our lives—layered, complicated, and worth exploring.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The secret challenge pushed me to step beyond observation and ask better questions. I realized that sometimes, cultural understanding isn't about "newness"—it's about seeing the familiar more truthfully.

      <h2>Closing Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This wasn’t just a scavenger hunt. It was a homecoming—from the outside in.
