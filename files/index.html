      <h2>My Initial Perception</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in Kenya, I thought I knew who Kenya was but I was wrong. I knew the sounds of city streets, the taste of chapati on a Sunday, and the fast driven matatus. But this journey peeled back layers I never paused to see. Places I passed every day transformed from scenery into stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not go to visit new place, I just saw familiar places differently. This experience changed how I look at history, people, and even myself. It taught me that culture isn’t stuck in time; it evolves around us every day, if we’re willing to pay attention.

          <h2>Outdoor Experiences</h2>
          <p>
            Our cultural trail led us to the <strong>Nairobi National Museum</strong> and the <strong>Museum of Illusions</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The National Museum felt like walking through memory, bones of early humans, heroes of independence, and stories told through art. For the first time in my life, I didn’t just observe, I was present and I listened. At the Museum of Illusions, we laughed, got dizzy, and learned how easy it is to trick the brain. Both spaces reminded me: perception and truth can live side by side.
          </p>
          <p>
            The quiet and calm serene of <strong>Kereita Forest</strong> was a welcome contrast. Hiking under the thick canopies and under fresh air, I felt more present than ever. No Wi-Fi, no noise, just breath, movement, and silence. That space felt healing. For someone passionate about mental health, this was more than just a walk, it was therapy.

      <h2>Culture in Conversation</h2>
      <p>
        I had three conversations that really stayed with me. Each one gave me a fresh perspective on what it means to be a Kenyan today.One was with a close friend in her twenties. We were just walking through town when she said, “To be a Kenyan is to hustle; even when it’s hard, we don’t stop.” She wasn’t trying to be deep; it was just how she sees life. But in that moment, it hit me, resilience isn’t just a national trait, it’s woven into our daily routines.

Then I sat down with my grandma', and just like the norm, she didnot hesitate. She told me, “Things have changed. Back then we used to be together built a community and so on, and now everyone wants to be alone or online.” For her, culture is about togetherness eating together, praying together, showing up for each other. Her words made me reflect on how tech is shaping our habits, sometimes bringing us closer, but also pushing us apart.

And finally, I met a local vendor who blew my mind. He said, “Kenyan culture is now remixing itself, Gen Zs wear shukas with Jordans, we paint street walls with Maasai prints and memes.” He wasn’t just talking about fashion or art; he was talking about identity. His words helped me realize that culture doesn’t have to be old to be valid, it just has to be lived.

The three voices made something click in me: culture isn’t frozen in time. It’s alive. It shifts. It travels in stories, in how we dress, how we joke, how we survive. It’s not locked in museums, it walks beside us, every single day.

      <h2>Personal Mission & Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that stories and silence can both heal. My mission is strongly rooted in<strong>mental health and emotional well-being</strong>, especially among youth. This experience showed me that cultural understanding and mental clarity go hand in hand. You can’t know who you are unless you understand where you come from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our dinner at <strong>Peppertree</strong> felt symbolic. The blend of global and local flavors on one plate reflected my own identity of being both modern and rooted but still exploring.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        If I could take someone like a foreigner anywhere in Kenya, it would not be in any fancy place or a park. I would take them to the downtown of Nairobi on a weekday rush hours especially. There, they’d feel the heartbeat of the city, people selling, solving, shouting, and laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is the real Kenya. It’s not curated it’s alive, gritty, brilliant. This scavenger hunt didn’t just change what I saw. It changed how I see.

      <h2>Closing Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This wasn’t just a cultural exercise, it was a return and maybe, a beginning.
